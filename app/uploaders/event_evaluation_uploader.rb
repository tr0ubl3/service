  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.

  #

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :thumb do
    process :resize_to_fill => [120, 120]
  end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  # def extension_white_list
  #   %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  # end

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
  # def filename
  #   "something.jpg" if original_filename
